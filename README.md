# REMIXER!
## by Garran Plum

- Collects in one monument any parts from the game or other mods.
- Requires no code changes (only config changes) to add parts.
- An example of simple, declarative modding with GPS.

## This repo requires my `gp` repo to be added as a `gp` folder inside (or use a symlink) before loading in Foundation.

## For a fully packaged version of this mod, download from the in-game menu or from the mod.io link below.
